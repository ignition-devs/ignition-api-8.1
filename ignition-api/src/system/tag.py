    """Issues a query to the Tag Historian.

    Querying Tag history involves specifying the tags and the date
    range, as well as a few optional parameters. The Tag historian will
    find the relevant history and then interpolate and aggregate it
    together into a coherent, tabular result set.

    Args:
        paths: An array of Tag paths (strings) to query. Each Tag path
            specified will be a column in the result dataset.
        startDate: The earliest value to retrieve. If omitted, 8 hours
            before current time is used. Optional.
        endDate: The latest value to retrieve. If omitted, current time
            is used. Optional.
        returnSize: The number of samples to return. -1 will return
            values as they changed, and 0 will return the "natural"
            number of values based on the logging rates of the scan
            class(es) involved. -1 is the default. Optional.
        aggregationMode: The mode to use when aggregating multiple
            samples into one time slice. Valid values are: "Average"
            (time-weighted), "MinMax", "LastValue", "SimpleAverage",
            "Sum", "Minimum", "Maximum", "DurationOn", "DurationOff",
            "CountOn", "CountOff", "Count", "Range", "Variance",
            "StdDev", "PctGood", and "PctBad". Optional.
        returnFormat: Use "Wide" to have a column per Tag queried, or
            "Tall" to have a fixed-column format. Default is "Wide".
            Optional.
        columnNames: Aliases that will be used to override the column
            names in the result dataset. Must be 1-to-1 with the Tag
            paths. If not specified, the Tag paths themselves will be
            used as column titles. Optional.
        intervalHours: Allows you to specify the window interval in
            terms of hours, as opposed to using a specific return size.
            Optional.
        intervalMinutes: Same as intervalHours, but in minutes. Can be
            used on its own, or in conjunction with intervalHours.
            Optional.
        rangeHours: Allows you to specify the query range in hours,
            instead of using start and end date. Can be positive or
            negative, and can be used in conjunction with startDate or
            endDate. Optional.
        rangeMinutes: Same as rangeHours, but in minutes. Optional.
        aggregationModes: A one-to-one list with paths specifying an
            aggregation mode per column. Optional.
        includeBoundingValues: A boolean flag indicating that the system
            should attempt to include values for the query bound times
            if possible. The default for this property depends on the
            query mode, so unless a specific behavior is desired, it is
            best to not include this parameter. Optional.
        validateSCExec: A boolean flag indicating whether or not data
            should be validated against the scan class execution
            records. If False, data will appear flat (but good quality)
            for periods of time in which the system wasn't running. If
            True, the same data would be bad quality during downtime
            periods. Optional.
        noInterpolation: A boolean flag indicating that the system
            should not attempt to interpolate values in situations where
            it normally would. This will also prevent the return of rows
            that are purely interpolated. Optional.
        ignoreBadQuality: A boolean flag indicating that bad quality
            values should not be used in the query process. If set, any
            value with a "bad" quality will be completely ignored in
            calculations and in the result set. Optional.
        timeout: Timeout in milliseconds for Client Scope. This property
            is ignored in the Gateway Scope. Optional.
        intervalSeconds: Same as intervalHours and interval Minutes, but
            in seconds. Can be used on its own, or in conjunction with
            intervalHours and intervalMinutes. Optional.
        rangeSeconds: Allows you to specify the query range in seconds,
            instead of using start and end date. Can be positive or
            negative, and can be used in conjunction with startDate or
            endDate. Optional.

    Returns:
        A dataset representing the historian values for the specified
        Tag paths. The first column will be the timestamp, and each
        column after that represents a Tag.

    Annotations are stored by the underlying historian implementations,

    1-to-1, so all provided lists should be of the same length. If a
    particular annotation doesn't need a parameter, that element can be
    None in the list.

    Args:
        paths: A list of Tag paths to store for. The paths are
            equivalent to what would be used for a Tag history query,
            and should specify the source provider as well. For example,
            ``"[HistoryProvider/Gateway:Provider]Path/To/Tag"``. This

    be recorded via scripting.

    The Tag paths are associated with a historical and realtime
    provider, but they do not necessarily need to exist in the realtime
    provider. This means records from non-existent (virtual) Tags can be
    stored in the Tag History system. Because of this, it is imperative
    that Tag paths passed to the function are typed precisely, otherwise
    the history will be stored at an incorrect path.

    Note that the Tag History system does cache Tag data. Thus, if this
    function is called, the Tag path and Tag id are cached until the
    history provider or gateway are restarted. This means manually
    removing the Tag from the sqlth_te table, and then calling this
    function again with the same path will not re-populate the Tag
    execution table (especially so when working purely with virtual Tag
    paths). Instead, the cache must first be cleared, and then a new
    entry will be added the next time this function is called.

    If a Tag's datatype changes after recording Tag history, this
    function will create a new entry in the sqlth_te table to reflect
    the change.

        historyprovider: The historical provider to store to.
        tagprovider: The name of the realtime Tag provider to associate
            these tags with. The Tag provider does not need to exist,
            and the Tag paths do not need to exist in it.
        paths: A list of paths to store. The values, qualities, and
            timestamps are one-to-one with the paths. A single path may
            be present multiple times in order to store multiple values.
        values: A list of values to store.
        qualities: A list of integer quality codes corresponding to the
            values. Quality codes can be found on the Tag Quality and

            Optional.

        alarm becoming active is one item, while the same alarm becoming

        startDate: The start of the time range to query. Defaults to 8
            hours previous to now if omitted. Time range is inclusive.

            can either be integers or strings, representing a number of
            states. Optional.
        path: A list of possible source paths to search at. The wildcard
            "*" may be used. Optional.

            below that path will be searched as well.
        all_properties: A set of property conditions, all of which must

            be a system event. Optional.
        provider: A list of tag providers to include in the query.

    alarm events retrieved by the `system.alarm.queryJournal` function.

    """Executes and distributes a report.

    Similar to scheduling a report to execute, except a schedule in not
    required to utilize this function. This is a great way to distribute
    the report on demand from a Client.

    Note:
        The function system.report.executeAndDistribute() does not run
        on its own thread and can get blocked. For example, if a printer
        is backed up and it takes a while to finish the request made by
        this function, the script will block the execution of other
        things on that thread until it finishes. Be sure to keep this in
        mind when using it in a script.

        actionSettings: An optional dictionary of settings particular to
            the action. Missing values will use the default value for
            that action.

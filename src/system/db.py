    Database transactions are used to execute multiple queries in an

    take place. The transaction is given a new unique string code, which
    is then returned. You can then use this code as the tx argument for
    other system.db.* function calls to execute various types of queries
    using this transaction.

    An open transaction consumes one database connection until it is
    closed. Because leaving connections open indefinitely would exhaust
    the connection pool, each transaction is given a timeout. Each time
    the transaction is used, the timeout timer is reset. For example, if
    you make a transaction with a timeout of one minute, you must
    complete that transaction within a minute. If a transaction is
    detected to have timed out, it will be automatically closed and its
    transaction id will no longer be valid.

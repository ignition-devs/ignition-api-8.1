    Args:
        project: The name of the project to retarget to.

            https://host:port when SSL/TLS is enabled on the target

            timeout period between each address attempt. Optional.
        params: A dictionary of parameters that will be passed to the
            new project. They will be set as global variables in the new
            project's Python scripting environment. Optional.
        windows: A list of window paths to use as the startup windows.
            If omitted, the project's normal startup windows will be
            opened. If specified, the project's normal startup windows
            will be ignored, and this list will be used instead.
